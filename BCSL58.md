#### Q1. What is numerical analysis?
Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation for the problems of mathematical analysis.

#### Q2. What is floating point representation?
To represent very big numbers and very tiny numbers this floating point representation is used to save computer memory.

#### Q3. What is floating point arithmetic?
Floating- point arithmetic is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation to support a trade-off between range and precision.

#### Q4. What are the properties of floating point arithmetic?
Floating-point numbers do not behave the same as the real numbers encountered in mathematics:
-  The set of floating-point numbers does not form a field under the usual set of floating –point operations.
- Some common rules of arithmetic are not always valid when applied to floating – point numbers.
- Floating – point numbers are all rational numbers.
-  But they are only a subset of the rational.
- Thus not all rational numbers are floating point numbers.
- There are only a finite number of floating point numbers.

#### Q5. What are the format to represent a number?
- Fixed point representation
- Floating point representation

#### Q6. What is significant digits?

Significant figures of a number in positional notation are digits in the number that are reliable and absolutely necessary to indicate the quantity of something.

#### Q7. What is normalization?

To convert the fixed point data to the floating point data is called normalization. It is done to preserve maximum numbers of useful information carrying digits of numbers.

#### Q8. What is Mantissa?

The definition of mantissa is the part of a number located after a decimal point.
An example of mantissa is 234 in the number 1101.234

#### Q9. What is Exponent?

An exponent is a number or letter written above and to the right of a mathematical expression called the base.

#### Q10. What is base?

A number base is the number of digits or combination of digits that a system of counting uses to represent numbers. A base can any whole number greater than 0.

#### Q11. How to find initial approximation to a root?

To compute a numerical approximation to a particular root, choose an initial guess close enough to that root. Close enough means a position x_0, from which the algorithm will not jump to another root –  however, this is not possible for particular kinds of roots.

#### Q12. What is Bisection method?

The Bisection method is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs.

#### Q13. What is Regula- Falsi method?

The Regula-Falsi method is a numerical method for estimating the roots of polynomial f(x). A value x replaces the midpoint in the Bisection Method and serves as the new approximation of root of f(x). The objective is to make convergence faster.

#### Q14. What is Newton’s method?

Newton’s method, also known as the newton – Raphson method, named after Issac Newton and Joseph Raphson, is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots of a real-valued function.

#### Q15. What is Secant method?

The Secant method is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function f. The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton’s method.

#### Q16. What is Gauss Elimination method?

Gaussian elimination also known as row reduction is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations. It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients.

#### Q17. What is Interpolation in Numerical Analysis?

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points


#### What is Composite Trapezoidal rule?
The Composite Trapezoidal rule is a method for approximating a definite integral by evaluating the integrand at n points.
